# SLEEF vs. SVML
Comparison of Run Time between [SLEEF Vectorized Math Library][1] and [Short Vector Math Library][2] (SVML).

## Version  
The current version is `2018_09_24_001`.

## Structure
The project is built on VS 2017 Project with require Intel Compiler 19 for compilation.  
The VS 2017 Solution includes 2 Project:

 1.	EXE File - Which is used to time the different functions.
 2.	DLL File - Which is used to compare the precision.  
 	The comparison is done in MATLAB compared to a reference which is calculated in `Float 64` precision.

## Remarks
 *	The test is using a single thread.
 *	The project is using `Single`  / `Float32` data type.
 *	Each test runs SSE and AVX flavors of the implementation.
 * 	The project is compiled with `/fp:precise`.

## Build
Open the Solution File (``) in Visual Studio with Intel Compiler 19 integrated and compile.

## Run
Run the EXE file using `SleefVsSvml.exe <TEST NUMBER> <NUM ELEMENTS> <NUM ITERATIONS> <NEGATIVE VALUES FLAG> <MAX VALUE>`.
Where:

 * 	`TEST NUMBER` - Sets the test to be executed.  
 	Valid Values:
  	*	`1` - Sine Function.
  	*	`3` - Exponent Function.
 *	`NUM ELEMENTS` - Sets the number of `Float32` elements in the array to process. Must be an integer multiplication of 16 (AVX).
 * 	`NUM ITERATIONS` - How many time to process the array to gather statistics of run time.
 * 	`NEGATIVE VALUES FLAG` - Sets whether to generate negative values in the array. `0` to allow only non negative values and `1` to generate negative values.
 * 	`MAX VALUE` - Sets the maximum **absolute** value of the array elements.

For example the following `SleefVsSvml.exe 1 100000000 100 1 50` will run 50 iterations the `sin` function on array with size of 1e8 elements with values of `[-50, 50]`.

The array elements are generated by a random number in the `[0, 1]` range then multiplied by `MAX VALUE` (If `NEGATIVE VALUES FLAG` is `1` then also shifted by half an multiplied by 2).

The project also includes a pre built `EXE` in the ZIP file.

## SLEEF
The included is based on SLEEF `3.3.1` compiled using SLEEF's build system with MSVC 2017 with forced `/MT` flag.

## TO DO
 *	Create *CMake* based build system.
 * 	Add more comparison function.
 * 	Support `fp:fast`.
 *	Display results on various systems (Run Time).
 *	Show precision performance compared in MATLAB.
