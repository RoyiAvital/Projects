# Optimization
Various projects in Optimization.

## Ball Projection
The orthogonal projection onto balls (L1, L2, Simplex, etc...).  
Includes both derivations and code for implementation.

## Convex Set Projection
The orthogonal projection onto various convex sets.

## Interrior Point Solver
Demo of Interrior Point Solver concept.

## LsL0SolversAnalysis
Analysis of perfromance of various solvers for the Linear Lease Squares Problem regularized by ${L}_{0}$ Norm.  
The prolens is given by:

$$ \arg \min_{x} \frac{1}{2} {\left\| A x - b \right\|}_{2}^{2} + \lambda {\left\| x \right\|}_{0} $$

## LsL1SolversAnalysis
Analysis of perfromance of various solvers for the Linear Lease Squares Problem regularized by ${L}_{1}$ Norm.  
The prolens is given by:

$$ \arg \min_{x} \frac{1}{2} {\left\| A x - b \right\|}_{2}^{2} + \lambda {\left\| x \right\|}_{1} $$

## Steepest Descent
The steepest descent direction under various norms.
Includes both derivations and code for implementation.
