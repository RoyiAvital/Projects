# Projects
Various Small Projects on Various Subjects.

## Calculate Distance Matrix
Implementation for calculation of the distance matrix between 2 sets of vectors.

## Clustering
Some implementations of *Clustering* algorithms.

## Deep Learning Matched Filter
Analyze the Matched Filter performance using Deep Learning.  
Mainly if it could have better performance compared to [Matched Filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matched_filter) in low SNR.  
Project in Progress...

## Dynamic Time Warping
Introduction and implementation of the [Dynamic Time Warping](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_time_warping) concept.

## Image Convolution
Implementation of Image Convolution using Multi Threading and SIMD (Vectrorization) for speed.
The project generates DLL / DYLIB / SO to be used in MATLAB.

## Image Bilateral Filter
Implementation of the Bilateral Filter for Image Processing.

## Image to Columns
Optimized C based implementation of MATLAB's [`im2col()`](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/im2col.html) function.

## Levinson Recursion
Implementation of the [Levinson Recursion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levinson_recursion) on MATLAB.  
This allows solving Linear System `A x = b` where `A` is a [Toeplitz Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toeplitz_matrix) in O(N^2) complexity instead of O(N^3) using classic solution.

## Localization 
Simulation of Localization Methods.  
Deriving DTOA / TDOA Localization Cramer Rao Lower Bound.

## Optimization
Various projects which are Optimization (Numerical Methods) oriented such as:

 * Projection into Balls (Like Norm Balls, the Simplex Ball, etc...).
 * Interior Point () - Implementation in MATLAB.
 * Steepest Descent - Calculation of the Steepest Descent Direction for various norms ($ {L}_{1} $, $ {L}_{2} $, $ {L}_{\infty} $).


## Singular Value Decomposition
A Presentation about [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition) (SVD).  
It covers the following:

 * Singular Value Theorem.
 * Applications
    * [Dimensionality Reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensionality_reduction).
    * [Solving Linear Equation System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_of_linear_equations) ([Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_least_squares_(mathematics))).
    * [Total Least Squares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_least_squares).
    * [Principal Component Analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis) (PCA).

The PDF can be viewed directly - [SVD Presentation PDF](https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https://github.com/RoyiAvital/Projects/raw/master/SingularValueDecomposition/SVD.pdf).

## SLEEF vs. SVML
Comparison (Run Time Benchmark) of SLEEF vs. SVML for various numerical functions.

## Task Assignment Problem
Analysis of a variation of the [Knapsack Problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knapsack_problem).

## To Do

 *  [Exploratory Principal Component Analysis](https://github.com/fchen365/epca).  
    Implement in MATLAB.
