# Clustering

Implementation of some *Clustering* algorithms.

## Clustering via LP Based Stabilities
A MATLAB implementation of the method [Clustering via LP Based Stabilities (NIPS 2009)](https://dblp.uni-trier.de/rec/conf/nips/KomodakisPT08.html).  
A Python code is available by [Lucas Fidon's Clustering via LP-based Stabilities](https://github.com/LucasFidon/Clustering-via-LP-based-Stabilities).

Requires `MATLAB R2020a` (Should be compatible to earlier versions by removing the `arguments` section).
